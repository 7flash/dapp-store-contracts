# dapp-store-contracts

The contracts backing dappstore.io.

EternalDB.sol is a generic key-value store, which serves as the "database" for these contracts. Model.sol implements a pseudo-SQL schema pattern on top of that.

The patterns shown here are new and fairly rough, though also useful. Build on top of them at your own peril!
